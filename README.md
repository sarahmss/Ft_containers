# Containers

In this project we have to reimplement some of STL containers and functionalitys.

<details> 
<summary> They are: </summary>

* Containers:

- [ ] vector
- [ ] map
- [ ] stack

* 
- [x] std::iterator_traits
- [x] std::reverse_iterator
- [ ] std::enable_if (c++11)
- [ ] std::is_integral
- [x] std::equal and/or std::lexicographical_compare
- [ ] std::pair
- [ ] std::make_pair

this needs to be done following the rules ahead:

- [ ] namespace = `ft`
- [ ] You cannot implement more public functions than the ones offered in the standard containers
- [ ] All the member functions, non-member functions and overloads of the standard containers are expected
- [ ] iterator system in containers that have it
- [ ] use std::alocator
